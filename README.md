# [AI for Good Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-good/)
Learn AI's role in addressing complex challenges. Build skills combining human and machine intelligence for positive real-world impact using AI

## About this Specialization
The AI for Good Specialization showcases how AI can be part of the solution when it comes to addressing some of the world’s biggest challenges in areas like public health, climate change, and disaster management.

In these courses, you’ll learn from instructor Robert Monarch, who has over 20 years of experience building AI products in industry and working at the intersection of AI and public health and disaster management. Robert is also the author of [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/human-in-the-loop-machine-learning), a book focused on human-centered AI applications. 

Throughout the courses, you'll hear from experts working on AI for Good initiatives aimed at addressing social and environmental issues. By combining human and machine intelligence, real-world datasets, best practices around data privacy, and ethical considerations, you’ll develop the knowledge and fundamental skills to tackle your own AI for good projects.

## Applied Learning Project
- Create an air quality monitoring application for the city of Bogotá, Colombia
- Explain the mechanisms behind anthropogenic climate change and the ways it is impacting global temperatures and weather patterns. 
- Identify ways in which AI techniques used in the context of addressing climate change, and use the techniques.
- Frame the role of AI in fighting climate change, the types of AI approaches that can be used, and the factors to consider when deploying AI in climate contexts.
- Explore a real-world wind power forecasting problem using the AI for Good framework 
- Use satellite imagery from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 to work through the entire AI for Good project pipeline.
