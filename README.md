## About this Specialization
The AI for Good Specialization showcases how AI can be part of the solution when it comes to addressing some of the world’s biggest challenges in areas like public health, climate change, and disaster management.

In these courses, you’ll learn from instructor Robert Monarch, who has over 20 years of experience building AI products in industry and working at the intersection of AI and public health and disaster management. Robert is also the author of [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/human-in-the-loop-machine-learning), a book focused on human-centered AI applications. 

Throughout the courses, you'll hear from experts working on AI for Good initiatives aimed at addressing social and environmental issues. By combining human and machine intelligence, real-world datasets, best practices around data privacy, and ethical considerations, you’ll develop the knowledge and fundamental skills to tackle your own AI for good projects.

## Course 1: AI and Public Health
The AI and Public Health course is designed to introduce learners to the concept of using artificial intelligence to address social and environmental issues.

We'll start by defining AI for Good, and explore various examples of AI for Good projects. You will get hands-on with a real-world concern, air quality in Bogotá, and use the AI for Good framework to define the problem, identify stakeholders, and determine where AI could fit. You will also learn how to interpret exploratory data analysis (EDA) graphs and use Python to explore air-quality data. The course also covers approaches for missing data imputation, model performance evaluation using mean absolute error (MAE), and interpreting EDA graphs and heatmaps.

This is the first course in the AI for Good Specialization, which demonstrates how AI is being utilized to address some of the world’s biggest challenges — and provides a framework for you to be part of the solution. 

This is a beginner-friendly course. Learners should know high school-level math and basic spreadsheet operations.

## Course 2: AI and Climate Change
In Course 2: AI and Climate Change, you will begin by learning the basics of anthropogenic climate change — why it is happening, its projected impacts, and how it is already driving extreme weather around the globe. You will then learn how machine learning techniques can lessen climate change’s impacts and help communities prepare for those that do occur.

Learners will take part in two hands-on labs. In the first, you will use data modeling techniques to visualize how climate change is modeled to cause average temperatures to change in different locations around the world. In the second, you will build a model that forecasts how much power wind turbines in different locations will generate.

## Course 3: AI and Disaster Management
In Course 3, AI and Disaster Management, you will begin by learning how natural disasters create both short and long-term impacts on the economy, environment, and community. You will learn how the disaster management cycle can be used to reduce the impacts of a disaster and guidelines for how you can engage in disaster-related projects. 

You will get hands-on experience through a pair of case studies. The first case study looks at Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, and the southern United States in 2017. You will use computer vision to identify hurricane damage from satellite imagery. The second focuses on the catastrophic 2010 earthquake in Haiti. You will use natural language processing (NLP) to compare requests for aid that victims made shortly after the earthquake with those that they made several months later.

This course is part of the AI for Good Specialization, which demonstrates how AI is being harnessed to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges — and provides a framework that you can apply to any AI for Good project in assessing if AI can add value.

This is a beginner-friendly course. Learners should know high school-level math and basic spreadsheet operations. It is recommended that learners first complete Course 1: AI and Public Health and Course 2: AI and Climate Change.
