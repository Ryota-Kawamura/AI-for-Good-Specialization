## Motivation

The datasets are a collection of mesurements of various pollutants at several measurement stations across Bogotá, Colombia. The dataset was downloaded to be used in the DLAI course "AI for Public Health". 

The datasets were downloaded from the public portal on the Red de Monitoreo de Calidad del Aire de Bogotá (RMCAB) website
http://201.245.192.252:81/home/map and RMCAB staff also gave explicit permission for the data to be used in this online course.



## Composition

There are two datasets in total.

1. RMCAB_air_quality_sensor_data.csv
	This is the main dataset that contains the measurements for various stations in Bogotá throughout 2021. The dataset includes the following columns: PM10, PM2.5, NO, NO2, NOX, CO, OZONO. Station, DateTime. DateTime and Station columns are fully populated, while the rest of the collumns (pollutants) are missing some values, because the measurements were not available. The dataset has 166441 rows in total.


2. stations_loc.csv
	This dataset includes additional information about each of the stations (type and location). It includes the following columns: estacion, Sigla, Latitud, Longitud, Altitud (m), Altura (m), Localidad, Tipo de zona, Tipo de estaciÃ³n, DirecciÃ³n. The dataset includes 21 rows, one for each station. Not all of the stations are present in dataset 1.
