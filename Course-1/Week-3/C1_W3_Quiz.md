- [ ] According to key metrics, you can show a measurable net improvement to some problem or scenario.
- [ ] On balance, those impacted by a project are more likely to have benefited than to have been harmed.
- [x] Everyone impacted by a project is left improved or unchanged in their status.

**4.** Which of the following would be appropriate statements about the capabilities of AI? Select all that apply.
- [x] AI can perform very well on some specific and well defined tasks.
- [x] The term "AI" refers to a computer program or algorithm that is capable of making decisions or performing inferences based on patterns in data.
- [x] In many cases, AI capabilities do not add value as a part of a potential solution.

**5.** Which of the following is a correct statement about how supervised machine learning works?
- [ ] AI is a subfield of supervised machine learning.
- [x] Supervised machine learning is where an algorithm is trained to learn the mapping from some set of inputs to a particular set of outputs.
- [ ] Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where a human developer "supervises" or manually adjusts an algorithm during training.

**6.** What should be your default when it comes to storing or publishing data that contains personally identifying or private information?
- [ ] As a default, you should not store or publish any information that was shared with you privately but it's ok to store or republish data containing personal or private information that was previously made public, like social media posts.
