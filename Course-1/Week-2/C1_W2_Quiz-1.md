**1.** What are the main phases of the AI for Good project framework presented in this course? Select all that apply.
- [x] Implement.
- [x] Explore.
- [x] Design.
- [ ] Publish.
- [x] Evaluate.

**2.** What are the main steps the explore phase? Select all that apply.
- [x] Engage stakeholders.
- [x] Determine if AI could add value.
- [x] Define the problem.
- [ ] Design the end user experience.

**3.** What are the main questions you need to ask yourself at the end of the design phase? Select all that apply.
- [x] How will your design address the problem you set out to work on?
- [ ] Who are the stakeholders?
- [x] What kind of model will you implement, and how will you measure its performance?
- [x] How will you address issues with imbalances, biases, privacy, or other concerns with your data?
- [x] How will the end user interact with your system?

**4.** Where was the potential to "do harm" in the maternal and infant health in Nigeria project? Select all that apply.
- [ ] There was no potential to do harm in this project.
- [x] The text messages being categorized contained personal information and people's health conditions. Exposing this information beyond the staff of the clinic would have the potential to do harm.
- [x] Bindly trusting AI model results in the area of healthcare could lead to poor health outcomes or physical harm.

**5.** In the maternal and infant health in Nigeria project, despite achieving satisfactory model performance and improving the efficiency of clinic staff, why was the project discontinued?
- [ ] The project was ultimately too expensive for long term implementation.
- [x] Clinic staff flet like they were spending too much time annotating data and less time with their patients.
- [ ] The AI system implemented was not able to improve the efficiency of clinic staff in terms of increased message throughput and reduced response times.

**6.** Imagine you're working with a team of medical professionals on a project to identify possible cancer cases from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. The problem they are faced with is that it can take days or weeks to receive an official diagnosis from a human pathologist because all MRI scans are placed in a queue and are reviewed by the pathologist in the order they were received. The vast majority of scans reveal no cancer and the team you are working with is interested in developing a way of identifying and prioritizing likely cancer cases immediately after a scan is completed such that they can be moved to the top of the queue for faster human review. Let's start with the problem definition. What might be a good problem definition for you case study?
- [ ] We need to identify cancer from MRI scans faster.
- [x] Medical professionals need a way to immediately identify likely cancer cases from MRI scans in order to give priority to patients that may be more likely to have cancer, such that their case can be quickly reviewed for diagnosis by a pathologist.
- [ ] Medical professionals need a way to quickly identify likely cancer cases from MRI scans.

**7.** Will AI add value as part of a potential solution for the MRI scan problem defined above?
- [ ] Yes. AI is always a strong choice when solving problems related to medical imaging.
- [x] AI may be a good choice for the problem, but you need to first assess the available data to see whether your project could benefit from an AI approach.
- [ ] No. AI does not bring any value when solving problems related to medical imaging, because these problems are too challenging.

**8.** For the medical imaging scenario described above, who might be some of the relevant stakeholders? Select all that apply.
- [x] Doctors, nurses, and other staff responsible for working with patients, running the MRI machine, recording images, and sending those images on for diagnosis from a pathologist.
- [x] Pathologists evaluating MRI scans.
- [x] Potentially others, like representatives or technicians from the company that produces the MRI machines, or stakeholders you have yet to identify.
- [x] Patients receiving MRI scans.

**9.** For the medical imaging scenario described above, suppose you have met with all the appropriate stakeholders, determined that you have access to the required data for the project, and that AI could likely add value. What are some of the steps you need to take in the next project phase (design phase)? Select all that apply.
- [ ] Define the problem you're going to work on.
- [x] Ensure that you have the appropriate methods in place to work with the medical imaging data securely and that you're not unnecessarily storing personally identifying information.
- [ ] Test your system with end users to verify whether they are able to interact with your system successfully.
- [x] Explore your data further and prototype a method for identifying likely cancer cases in MRI scnas.
- [x] Design the way in which end users will interact with your system, in this case, everything from the step of receiving a new MRI scan to analyzing and ultimately prioritizing that scan in the queue for review by a pathologist.

**10.** Suppose for the medical imaging scenario above, you have obtained a large collection of patient records, which include personal information and you got all the right permissions for your use case. Let's assume you have trained your algorithms, deployed your system, and you do not need this data anymore. What should you do with the data?
- [x] Since you don't need this data anymore, you should delete it as it includes personal information.
- [ ] SInce your algorithm perform very well, you want to share the results with the community. You can publish your results in a journal and you can include the data, because you are publishing it for a good cause.
- [ ] You should store the data securely, just in case you or someone else needs it for a later project.
