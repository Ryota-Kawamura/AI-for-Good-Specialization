**1.** PM2.5 particles are one of the most impactful pollutants in terms of negative effects on public health. Why? Select all that apply.
- [x] They are produced in large quantities through the burning of fossil feuls.
- [x] They can contain ash, metals, organic chemicals and other toxins.
- [x] They are very small and get deep into your lungs and bloodstream.

**2.** How does measuring air quality relate to addressing the problem of air pollution in a broader sense?
- [ ] It helps to improve air quality directly.
- [x] It helps to identify long term trends and quantify the magnitude of the problem.
- [x] It can be used to inform public policy aimed at reducing air pollution.
- [x] It can be used to inform the public when the air is safe or unsafe.

**3.** Which of the following are true concerning "modern ambient" air pollution (as distinguished from other types of air pollution)?
- [x] Deaths due to air pollution are on the rise due, in large part, to an increase in modern ambient air pollution.
- [x] Modern ambient air pollution is on the rise.
- [ ] Modern ambient air pollution is declining while indoor air pollution is on the rise.
- [x] Modern ambient air pollution is outdoor air pollution mostly caused by human activities on scales that affect large populations.

**4.** What is likely to be the most impactful action governments can take to reduce modern ambient air pollution affecting their citizens?
- [ ] Invest in technologies that can be used to clean the air and remove pollutants.
- [x] Enact policies to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.
- [ ] Launch public awareness campaigns to make citizens aware of the risks of air pollution and actions they can take to protect their health.

**5.** Go to https://map.purpleair.com/ or any other air quality site you find online and look at recent measurements from the nearest sensor station to your location. What is the air quality at the station? (there is no wrong answer for this question)
- [ ] Green color, clean air!
- [x] Yellow / orange, it is not good, but not too bad.
- [ ] Red / purple color, the quality of the air is bad.

**6.** In your initial exploration of the data, how frequently are the dta points recorded at each of the sensor stations (Explore phase videos for the air quality project)?
- [ ] Every second.
- [x] Hourly.
- [ ] Daily.
- [ ] Every minute.

**7.** What was one interesting takeaway from exploring the distributions of PM2.5 sensor data via histograms and boxplots (Explore phase lab walkthrough videos)?
- [ ] The vast majority of data point are at very high levels of measured pollution, while recordings of low levels of pollution are relatively sparse. Have another look at the lab walkthrough videos for the explore phase of the air quality project.
- [ ] All the sensor stations are reporting the same range and distribution of values.
- [x] The vast majority of data points are at relatively low levels of pollution, while recordings of high levels of pollution are relatively sparse.

**8.** Which of the other pollutants is most strongly correlated to PM2.5? (Explore Air Quality videos)
- [ ] NOX
- [x] PM10
- [ ] NO
- [ ] CO2

**9.** What is the approximate percentage of missing data across the various columns of sensor measurement data?
- [x] 20-30%
- [ ] 1-2%
- [ ] 80-90%

**10.** What is the long-term goal of the city of Bogota with regard to improving air quality in the city?
- [x] To have 70% of the city within the recommended healthy long-term limits for air quality by 2030.
- [ ] To have 100% of the city within the recoomended healthy long-term limits for air quality by 2030.
- [ ] To make citizens aware of when it is safe to engage in outdoor activities.
