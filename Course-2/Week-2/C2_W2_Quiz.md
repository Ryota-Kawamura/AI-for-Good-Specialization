**2.** Companies that provide wind power to the electrical grid need to be able to make reliable predictions of wind power output because: (Select all that apply)
- [ ] Nowadays, most electric companies are serving the vast majority of demand with wind power, so reliable predictions are essential.
- [x] Wind power can be unpredictable, so having better forecasts of wind power output helps electrical utility companies plan to balance input power sources into the electrical grid.
- [ ] Having reliable wind power predictions helps electrical companies generate more energy from fossil fuels.
- [x] Reliable predictions of wind power output increase the value of wind power as an alternative to fossil fuels.

**3.** Which of the following is necessary for Al to play a role in addressing a problem? ds
- [x] Access to or the ability to acquire the data that you need to develop and test potential models.
- [ ] Access to a ready-to-use dataset.
- [ ] A successful track record of other groups using Al for the same problem.
- [ ] The existence of a public dataset related to your problem definition.

**4.** What is the purpose of computing descriptive statistics for the numerical columns in the Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting (SDWPF) dataset?
- [x] To understand the characteristics of the data and look for anomalies.
- [ ] To determine which rows of data you need to drop.
- [ ] To predict the wind energy output of the entire wind farm.
- [ ] To find the top 10 performing wind turbines.

**5.** What are some of the reasons for first developing a baseline model for any Al project you want to work on? Select all that apply.
- [x] It allows you to set a benchmark for performance that you can use for comparison to the performance of more complex models.
- [x] A simple baseline model may prove to be sufficient for the task you aim to perform.
- [x] A simple baseline model often allows for more interpretable results.

**6.** In the first wind power design phase lab, which of the following was true of using a neural network model for estimating wind power output compared to the linear baseline model?
- [ ] The neural network model was trained using additional features beyond those used to fit the linear baseline model.
- [x] The neural network model was able to learn nonlinear patterns in the data.
- [x] The neural network performed better as measured by mean absolute error, compared to the linear model.

**7.** Which of the following is a use case for a sequence-to-sequence model? Select all that apply.
- [x] Translating text from Haitian Kreyol from Haiti to English.
- [x] Completing a poem when you provide the first few words.
- [x] Given historical hourly measurements of air pollution concentrations in a city, estimate the future concentration values.
- [x] Question answering like in the case of a chatbot.

**8.** Why is it important to have a separate "test set" of data when splitting your data into train, validation, and test sets?
- [x] To test how your model performs on data that it never saw during training.
- [ ] To evaluate the performance of the model during training.
- [ ] To select the best model among different alternatives.

**9.** What critical input feature did you need to "synthesize" in order to get your forecasting model working satisfactorily?
- [x] Synthesized wind speed forecasts.
- [ ] Synthesized uncertainty values for active power output.
- [ ] Synthesized temperature forecasts.

**10.** In your wind power prediction project, you used mean absolute error to evaluate different models' performance. Which of the following might be the success metrics or criteria by which you could assess your entire project assuming you moved through to implementation and deployment of this system?
- [ ] The relative improvement over a baseline of random guessing.
- [x] The amount by which your project serves to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels.
- [x] The amount by which you increase the value of wind energy by increasing its predictability.
