**1.** How are climate change and biodiversity related? Select all that apply.
- [x] Climate change contributes to the loss of habitats for different animals and plants, which can lead to extinction of these species.
- [x] Biodiversity loss undermines nature's ability to cope with climate change.
- [ ] Global warming is the primary reason for the disappearance of important ecosystems.
- [x] Protecting and preserving biodiversity through protection and restoration of natural ecosystems can help in the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

**2.** What are some of the drivers of the so-called "sixth mass extinction"? Select all that apply.
- [x] Climate change.
- [x] Land development.
- [x] Hunting and fishing.
- [x] Pollution of the environment.

**3.** Which of the following types of data are used in biodiversity monitoring with Al? Select all that apply.
- [x] Audio recordings.
- [x] Satellite imagery.
- [x] Camera trap data.

**4.** True or false: A United Nations study concluded that with just 2 degrees celsius of global warming, 99 percent of coral reefs would die off.
- [x] True.
- [ ] False.

**5.** How can Al be used to help in biodiversity monitoring? Select all that apply.
- [x] Al can be used to monitor deforestation through automatic interpretation of satellite imagery.
- [x] Al can be used to detect and classify animals in camera trap images.
- [ ] Al can be used to create a wind power forecast in order to generate renewable energy more efficiently.
- [x] Al can be used to process audio recordings and detect the presence of animals based on their characteristic sounds.

**6.** Which of the following statements are true about the use of camera trap data for biodiversity monitoring? Select all that apply.
- [x] Camera traps use motion sensors to trigger a camera to take pictures of anything that comes by.
- [x] Camera traps may record thousands or even millions of images, which would be difficult or impossible for an individual or a small team to analyze manually.
- [x] Beyond animals, camera traps are also likely to record pictures of people and vehicles, which need to be treated as personal private information.

**7.** Why is it that we seem to know much more about trends in biodiversity of mammals and other relatively large species than we do for microbes?
- [x] Large animals are relatively easy to count, track, listen for, or take pictures of, while microbe populations may require special techniques to study in detail.
- [x] Large animals (a.k.a. "charismatic megafauna") tend to capture peoples' attention more readily than microbes when it comes to issues of biodiversity loss and the destruction of natural ecosystems.
- [ ] Microbes are less important than large animals to the health of ecosystems and therefore are less important to study.

**8.** Which of the following are true about an imbalanced dataset? Select all that apply.
- [x] If you have an imbalanced dataset, collecting more examples for underrepresented classes can help.
- [x] When you are working on an image classification problem and you have many images of some classes, but only a few images for other classes you can say you have imbalanced data.
- [ ] Imbalanced data is not a problem, as the neural network anyway does not distinguish between the classes, before it is trained.

**9.** What are some of the issues you identified in the dataset in the data exploration lab for the Snapshot Karoo project? Select all that apply.
- [x] The dataset is highly imbalanced (there are many images of some animals and very few images of other animals).
- [x] Some animals may appear very close or very far from the camera, making them difficult to recognize.
- [x] The images are taken and labeled in sequences, thus some images in the sequence may not contain the animal at all.

**10.** True or False: For your dataset in the Snapshot Karoo project, a naive model that simply predicted "Gemsbok / Oryx" for every example would be correct more than 25% of the time.
- [x] True.
- [ ] False.
