**1.** What is the main factor behind the various manifestations of climate change?
- [ ] Extreme drought in some locations.
- [ ] Heavy flooding in some locations.
- [ ] Stable global average temperature leading up to the 20th century.
- [x] Increasing global temperatures.

**2.** Rising temperatures on Earth coincides with the following: (Select all that apply)
- [x] An increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
- [ ] An increase in human energy consumption, mainly from renewable sources.
- [x] An increase in human energy consumption, mainly from fossil fuels.

**3.** What is the primary way increased greenhouse gasses impact the atmospheric temperatures on Earth?
- [x] Greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane rise into the atmosphere and act to trap heat radiation that would otherwise escape into space (the greenhouse effect), which causes an increase in average temperatures across the globe.
- [ ] Greenhouse gasses act to reduce the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and make the Earth habitable.
- [ ] The greenhouse effect causes ice in the polar regions to thaw. As ice melts, the Earth's temperature increases.

**4.** What are some of the potential impacts of global warming? Select all that apply.
- [x] Loss of biodiversity.
- [x] Larger and more frequent wildfires.
- [x] Extreme weather events.

**5.** Which sentences are true about mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change? Select all that apply.
- [x] Adaptation strategies are those that aim to help us adapt to changing climate by working to reduce the impacts of the effects of climate change.
- [x] Some strategies, such as water conservation and sustainable agriculture can be considered both mitigation and adaptation strategies.
- [x] Mitigation strategies are those that work to reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere through reduced emission, protection of natural sinks and reservoirs of carbon, and removal of carbon from the atmosphere.

**6.** What does the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius" require in terms of a reduction in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere?
- [ ] The 1.5 degree target will require a dramatic increase in the production of nuclear energy.
- [ ] The 1.5 degree target will require replacing fossil fuels entirely with renewable energy sources by the year 2030.
- [x] The 1.5 degree mark requires reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and / or removing carbon from the atmosphere totaling 30 gigatons per year by the year 2030.

**7.** Potential uses of AI in the context of climate change are: (Select all that apply)
- [ ] Help to provide air quality estimates and inform public policy regarding air pollution.
- [x] Analyze and predict the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and natural ecosystems.
- [x] Optimize the predictability of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.

**8.** True or False: As shown in the lab walkthrough and course videos, global temperatures are increasing evenly around the surface of the earth.
- [x] False.
- [ ] True.

**9.** In the lab, how did the average temperature change you observed for land-based stations compare to the global average temperature change?
- [x] The land-based temperature change was higher, around 1.5 degrees celsius rise compared to about 1.1 degrees as a global average.
- [ ] The land-based temperature change was about the same as the global average, around 1.1 degrees celsius.
- [ ] The land-based temperature change was less than the 1.1 degrees global average temperature rise.

**10.** True or False: The changing climate means that all populations around the world will experience warmer temperatures no matter the season.
- [x] False.
- [ ] True.
