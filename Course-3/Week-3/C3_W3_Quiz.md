**1.** Which of the following challenges were addressed by the Haitian diaspora and Mission 4636 during the response efforts after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010? Select all that apply.
- [ ] Inability to communicate with people in impacted areas due to damaged communication infrastructure.
- [x] Limited mapping capabilities for locating specific places mentioned in the messages.
- [x] The lack of automatic translation technology between Haitian Kreyol and English.

**2.** Which stakeholders did you identify during the explore phase of this project modeling text messages sent after the Haiti earthquake? Select all that apply.
- [x] Organizations involved in the response effort in Haiti and those that might be likely to be involved in future responses, such as local organizations and international NGOs.
- [x] Members of the impacted community, including Haitians on the island and within the global diaspora.

**3.** Given what you explored in the topic modeling lab for this project, what can you infer about the evolution over time of the two topics initially identified (before removal of additional stopwords or other modifications you may have done)?
- [ ] The most important topic shifts from long-term recovery concerns to urgent needs as time progresses after the disaster.
- [x] Initially, the focus is primarily on critical needs, but beyond four weeks or so after the disaster, the need for information or other long-term recovery support surpasses the need for immediate assistance.
- [ ] The need for critical assistance, such as food and medical care, remains constant for months following the disaster.

**4.** Imagine that you are working to provide support for disaster preparation and response for another low-resource language region and you'd like to use the analysis from this topic modeling project based on the data from Haiti. Which of the following would be considerations in this effort?
- [x] The dataset is drawn from a specific event, the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, and the challenges presented in a new location and scenario may be quite unique and different from the experience in Haiti.
- [ ] The Haiti dataset contains personally identifying information (PII), which could raise privacy concerns.
- [ ] It would be wise to run similar analyses on other post-disaster scenarios to see which of the insights drawn 
from Haiti generalize well to other situations and what new insights you can draw from other scenarios.

**5.** If an earthquake happened today in a region where low-resource language speakers were impacted, which of the following might be effective in efforts to help coordinate the initial response based on your analysis of text messages sent after the Haiti example?
- [x] Helping to mobilize the local community and speakers of the local language in translation and geolocation efforts to help with logistics in the response and recovery phases.
- [ ] Doing damage assessment via aerial imagery to identify areas most likely to be in need of assistance.
- [ ] Developing a new automated translation app for the local language so that aid requests can be directed to the international respondents.

**6.** Identity the key steps you performed in text processing to convert the text messages in your dataset into a set of tokens for your analysis. Select all that apply.
- [x] Removal of stop words, which involved removing words that added little or no meaning to the message content.
- [x] Lemmatization, which involved reducing words to their root form
- [x] Removal of punctuation.
- [ ] Flagging of important keywords

**7.** True or false: Due in large part to the efforts of the Haitian diaspora and Mission 4636, translating and geolocating messages in Haitian Kreyol is now a manageable task for a non-Haitian-Kreyol speaker with access to the internet and this will ensure that many of the challenges faced by responders in 2010 will be easier to overcome in future crises in Haiti.
- [x] True
- [ ] False

**8.** Which set of steps best describes the overall process you performed to prepare your data for topic modeling?
- [x] Removing stop words from a word cloud reduces the clutter and makes more meaningful and relevant words stand out.
- [ ] For messages containing information about 'medical_products', the most common word is 'medicine'.
- [x] The most common words appear larger in size than less common words in the dataset.

**9.** Which of the following are true statements about coherence score?
- [x] A coherence score is one way to evaluate the performance of an LOA-based topic model.
- [x] The coherence score is defined in such a way that higher (less negative) values reflect a greater degree of coherence.
- [ ] A coherence score measures how different and unique the topics are in the set by looking at the variety of words used.

**10.** True or false: When it comes to machine learning applied in disaster response scenarios, it's actually much more common to be engaged in applying machine learning in after-the-fact analysis like you have done in this project than it is to apply machine learning directly as part of the response effort.
- [x] True.
- [ ] False.
