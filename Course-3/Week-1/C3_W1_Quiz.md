**1.** Which of the following may be reasons that a government could be motivated to classify an event as a disaster? Select all that apply.
- [x] To trigger the deployment funding and resource allocation toward the response and recovery efforts.
- [ ] To avoid public panic or unrest.
- [x] To circumvent due process in the name of expediency, like martial law.

**2.** What are the four phases of the disaster management cycle as presented in this course?
- [ ] Response, Relief, Reconstruction, and Mitigation.
- [ ] Education, Preparation, Relief, and Response.
- [x] Mitigation, Preparation, Response, and Recovery.

**3.** True or false: In disaster management scenarios, it's important to deploy the best technologies available and that means, when it comes to Al solutions, cutting-edge applications are generally the most effective.
- [ ] True.
- [x] False.

**4.** When it comes to applications involving analysis of social media data for the purposes of disaster management, which of the following is true?
- [x] In general, analyzing social media posts is not helpful in disaster management. On the contrary, groups that claim to be developing tools for the analysis of social media data in the context of disaster management are often working on tools to monitor populations for political purposes.
- [ ] Real-time analysis of social media immediately following a disaster can be critical in assessing the needs of impacted communities.
- [ ] Groups pursuing analysis of English language social media for disaster management are well positioned to make a positive impact due to the advanced state of development of natural language processing techniques for English.

**5.** When it comes to supporting disaster management for low-resource language communities, what sorts of technologies have the most potential for significant positive impacts? Please select all that apply.
- [ ] Automatic damage assessment tools, like technologies that can identify damaged buildings from satellite imagery.
- [ ] Forecasting technologies that allow for the accurate prediction of when a disaster is likely to occur.
- [x] General purpose technologies, like translation, search, and mapping applications.

**6.** True or false: Floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other events often termed "natural disasters" do not actually constitute disasters in and of themselves. Rather, it is the impact of these events on populations, infrastructure, and economies that can constitute a disaster.

- [ ] True.
- [x] False.

**8.** What are the important considerations to keep in mind when collecting or publishing data or conducting research in disaster response?
- [x] Aggregated data, as well as analytical models like machine learning models and the results they produce may be sensitive in ways that individual data points are not, so it's important to take privacy and sensitivity into account when considering the publication of aggregated data, models, and results, the same as you would for individually sensitive data.
- [ ] In disaster response scenarios, time is of the essence and it may be necessary to disregard certain privacy practices when it comes to the collection and distribution of personal or sensitive data.
- [ ] Only data that has already been made public, like peoples' posts on social media should be considered appropriate for republication. Other than that, any personal information should be maintained private and never stored or published.

**9.** What does the "do no harm" principle imply in the context of disaster management?
- [x] Just like in any Al for Good project, "do no harm" in disaster management means that everyone impacted by your project should be left better off or at least unharmed by your work, but it also means respecting local customs and social norms, and prioritizing the needs and perspectives of impacted communities.
